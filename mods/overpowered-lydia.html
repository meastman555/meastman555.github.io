                <p class="generaltext">Followers in Skyrim die too quickly, and often by the player’s own hand. This always frustrated me, 
                but instead of downloading an already made mod to fix this, I decided to learn how to do it myself, while making a few additional 
                changes in the process. I chose to buff Lydia, because you meet her early in the game, and she is a well balanced, valuable 
                follower (and a lovable meme, but that’s not as important). I dramatically scaled her melee weapon up, while making her invulnerable. 
                Does this break the game a little bit? Yes. Does it make obliterating dragons THAT much better? Absolutely.</p>
                <p class="generaltext">A simple mod, all I had to do was manipulate Lydia’s NPC through the Creation Kit; no scripting or 
                external assets were needed.</p>
