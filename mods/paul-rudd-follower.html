                <p class="generaltext">Paul Rudd. He’s Ant Man, an acclaimed actor, and now … a Skyrim follower? This mod allows the 
                    Dragonborn to be accompanied by a fully-voiced Elf Paul, complete with full Elvish armor and enchanted weapons. He can be 
                    found in the Bannered Mare, and will accompany you in fights at range using his bow or up close with his dagger.</p>
                <p class="generaltext">A decent amount of work went into creating this, as it was the first mod I was attempting more than 
                    simple manipulation of existing weapons/assets. I had to first design a custom NPC in-engine and allow for the game to 
                    treat it as a follower. Then I had to make sure the player could interact with my NPC in all the ways they would interact 
                    with a vanilla follower. Next came Paul’s custom armor, weapons, and behavior in combat. The engine provided the settings 
                    and traits I would need to manipulate, but I still had to learn which values and boxes corresponded to which behaviors and 
                    traits in-game. My challenge was uncovering the in-game dialogue that needed to be edited, rewriting it, and replacing the 
                    audio with trimmed clips of Paul Rudd from the internet. I also had to ensure my updates were correctly linked to only my new NPC.</p>
