            <p class="content_description">Followers in Skyrim die too quickly, and often accidentally by the player’s own hand. This always frustrated me, but instead of 
                downloading an already made mod to fix this, I decided to learn how to do it myself, while making a few additional changes in the process. 
                I chose to buff Lydia, because you meet her early in the game, and she is a well balanced, valuable follower (and a lovable meme, but that’s not as important). 
                I dramatically scaled her melee weapon up, while making her invulnerable. Does this break the game a little bit? Yes. Does it make obliterating dragons THAT much better? Absolutely.
                </br></br>
                A simple mod, all I had to do was manipulate Lydia’s NPC through the Creation Kit; no scripting or external assets were needed.
