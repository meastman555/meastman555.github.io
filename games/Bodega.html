            <p class="content_description"><i>Bodega</i> is a linear, narrative game I helped create as part of a game jam to help raise awareness for BLM. There were five themes for this jam; 
                they were "Equality, Diversity, Justice, Opportunity, and Inclusivity." This game is a lesson in being patient with everyone, and extending true justice as an arm of equality. 
                Nuance and humanity are big themes of this narrative experience, as you interact with a child and take the time to learn the reasoningbehind his actions. I did all of the 
                programming for this game, and had a decent amount of narrative input. My tasks included: movement, object interaction, button prompts/linking, and a dialogue system. 
                This was the first time I had to implement a basic dialogue system; in this way I contributed to the narrative as well. Originally we wanted branching dialogue options, but due to time 
                contraints and lack of experience, I was unable to achieve this functionality. I worked with our narrative designer to determine and code the linear path we found most fitting. 
                Ultimately, we ended up with a finished product that tells an intriguing and very human story that everyone can relate to (due in part to the purposefully ambiguous gray player character).
