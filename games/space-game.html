                <p class="generaltext">Space Game is a game created for the Global Game Jam in early 2020 -- "repair" was the theme. The goal
                    of the game is to work cooperatively with another player (locally) to pilot an astronaut and ship around levels to find and 
                    repair a broken satellie, through quicktime input. If the ship hits a wall or an asteroid, the astronaut must fly in and repair
                    the ship in the same way. My team at this jam was comprised of most of my teammates on <i>Endangered</i>, along with a 
                    few new faces. My role for this game was programmer. During the weekend, I was responsible for writing C# scripts that handled
                    controller input, movement, transitions, and the main menu. In addition I helped with some in-engine programming. Slightly ambitious,
                    this project pushed the boundaries of what a group of beginners could accopmlish in one weekend.

                <p class="generaltext" style="font-size: 30px;">Controls:</p>
                <p class="generaltext"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Astronaut</span>: Controller -- left stick to move, X to increase tether, 
                    B to decrease tether; face buttons (A-B-X-Y) for quick-time input. Keyboard -- I, J, K, L to move; these mappings happened very last 
                    minute due to build errors, so tether controls and quick-time input were not able to be sufficiently mapped in time.</p>
                <p class="generaltext"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spaceship</span>: Controller -- left trigger to turn counterclockwise,
                    right trigger to turn clockwise, A button to move forward. Keyboard -- A to turn counterclockwise, D on to turn clockwise; 
                    space-bar to move forward.</p>
