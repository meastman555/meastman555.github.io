            <p class="content_description"><i>Hunny-Bee</i> is a very short and simple mini-game made during the first special Mega-Micro jam hosted by UT's Game Development Club.
                Inspired by the <i>Wario-ware</i> franchise, we wanted to do something similar, where every jam team would contribute a small mini-game (or multiple) following a theme
                to be a part of a larger collection of these minigames. I worked on this game with my younger brother and my girlfriend -- since this game was much easier and smaller
                in scope, I used a lot of time educating them on how games get made and walked my brother through some coding, since he has some interest in programming and game design. 
                I still wrote most of the code, which included linking animations, determing win/lose conditions, input, and interacting with the already established codebase for the project
                (written by some other officers in advance of the jam). This was a great chance to practice writing efficient code in a short amount of time, since this wasnt a whirlwind of
                "just write it fast and make sure it works we don't have time to make it look pretty" coding like a normal game jam. All in all a super fun project to work on and teaching experience!</p>

            <p class="content_description">When played from the full game, it is impossible to pause to take adequate screenshots, so these are from the solo build of the game. 
                In the full game, the yellow border and timer are replaced with a thematic background and dynamic timer, but Hunny-Bee looks the exact same.
