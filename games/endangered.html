                <p class="generaltext">Endangered is a Unity-based game I helped create during a 36-hour Game Jam at UT. It’s the first legitimate 
                    game I made, using more than public, on-line art and block-coding. I collaborated with a group of friends and an industry mentor 
                    from Bethesda Game Studios in Austin (all credits can be found by pressing “enter/return” at the title screen). My role was lead 
                    programmer. My tasks included all of the C# scripts for character movement, level and cut-scene transitions, object interactions and behaviors; 
                    I was also responsible for enabling responsive and intuitive user input, and fixing most bugs we came across (if only it were 
                    physically possible to squash every bug). I also had a minor role in design: as programmer, I helped decide which aspects would have 
                    to be cut — due to the potential time needed to implement them — and tweaked features for a better user experience.</p>
