                <p class="generaltext">It's everybody's worst nightmare; and now it's a video game. Naked Nightmare is the third game my game jam group and I have made together, the first two being Endangered and Space Game. 
                    This jam was once again through the University of Texas' game development club, although this time around I was both a participant and a manager (being the president of the club at the time). Nonetheless, we all worked hard
                    on this game and it's our best yet; I'm particularly happy with the programming I did. This is a stealth-based line-of-sight game, as well as the first game I've made with a proper cutscene. The former required me to use vector
                    math that I knew from both my previous linear algebra class, and the vector calculus class I was taking the semester of this jam. I had to use it to calculate the distance and angle between the player character and the "enemies,"
                    to determine if the player was in their line of sight. Objects would block this line of sight. For the cutscene, I had to learn how to use Unity's animation window within the editor, something I haven't done before, 
                    in order to time the camera movements to the audio, and transition to gameplay once the cutscene ended. Overall, even though the gameplay is simple, this game required me to know and code more math than my previous games, 
                    and it was the first substantial game I've made where I can practically see why calculus and vectors are so important in gameplay programming.
