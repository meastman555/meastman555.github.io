            <p class="content_description"><i>Space Game!!!</i> is a game created for the Global Game Jam in early 2020 -- "repair" was the theme. The goal
                of the game is to work cooperatively with another player (locally) to pilot an astronaut and ship around levels to find and 
                repair a broken satellie, through quicktime input. If the ship hits a wall or an asteroid, the astronaut must fly in and repair
                the ship in the same way. My team at this jam was comprised of most of my teammates on <i>Endangered</i>, along with a 
                few new faces. My role for this game was programmer. During the weekend, I was responsible for writing C# scripts that handled
                controller input, movement, transitions, and the main menu. In addition I helped with some in-engine programming. Slightly ambitious,
                this project pushed the boundaries of what a group of beginners could accomplish in one weekend.

            <p class="content_description">Controls: <b>Astronaut</b>: (Xbox Controller) Left stick to move, X to increase tether, B to decrease tether, face buttons for quick-time input;
                (Keyboard) I-J-K-L for movement. This happened very late due to build errors, so the other controls were not mapped in time.
                <b>Spaceship</b>: (Xbox Controller) Triggers to turn, A to move forward; (Keyboard) A-D to turn, Spacebar to move forward.
