            <p class="content_description"><i>Endangered</i> is a Unity-based game I helped create during a 36-hour Game Jam at UT. It’s the first legitimate 
                game I made, using more than public, on-line art and block-coding. I collaborated with a group of friends and an industry mentor 
                from Bethesda Game Studios in Austin (all credits can be found by pressing “enter/return” at the title screen). My role was lead 
                programmer. My tasks included all of the C# scripts for character movement, level and cut-scene transitions, object interactions and behaviors; 
                I was also responsible for enabling responsive and intuitive user input, and fixing most bugs we came across (if only it were 
                physically possible to squash every bug). I also had a minor role in design: as programmer, I helped decide which aspects would have 
                to be cut — due to the potential time needed to implement them — and tweaked features for a better user experience.
