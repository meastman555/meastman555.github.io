                <p class="generaltext">All jokes aside, this website is my first foray into the world of web development. Most of my programming experience
                    is in the vain of low-level C applications and algorithms/data structures with Java (for college courses), so this is definitely 
                    something new. Keeping myself busy throughout the quarentine of the global Coronavirus pandemic, I learned the HTML5 and CSS3 I needed
                    to create this front-end only website through online StackSkills&copy; video-lessons, and by browsing plenty of tutorials on w3schools&copy;,
                    some of which's code examples I used (with credit) to create this website. I wanted to do everything from scratch to learn it by hand,
                    so I opted not to use Bootstrap during my development. Through the use of media queries, this site looks good on any viewing
                    screen, desktop or mobile. As I learn new aspects/languages of web-development, and continue to practice my skills, this site will likely
                    change for the better!
