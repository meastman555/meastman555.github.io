                    during my time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of media queries ensures that it will dynamically look good on any-sized screen. Being new to web-dev, 
                    there are certainly things I could do better and clean up -- as I continue to practice and learn new skills and languages, this site will likely change for the better!</p>

                <p class="generaltext">A toy operating system that I heavily expanded on as part of my Operating Systems class at UT, along with my group members. We designed and implemented various aspects of functionality for this OS,
                    such as priority donation (used to improve locks and semaphores) and scheduling, the ability to support user-programs and handle system calls, virtual memory (including a frame table, supplemental page table, and swap table),
                    and a file-system (using our own implemented double-indirect blocks) with working disk permanance and directory navigation/manipulation structures. I always find myself referencing these concepts, as even the higher
                    level video game code I write for my projects can be traced back to these fundamental computer and programming concepts. Due to this being a series of school projects for grades, I am unable to share the code I wrote.</p>

                <p class="generaltext">During the COVID-19 pandemic, I also spent my time in quarantine learning the basics of Python through more Stackskills&copy; tutorials. My first independent project is a password encrypter/decrypter
                    that uses the Vigen&egrave;re cipher (which encrypts words/phrases with a user-memorized key). Users will give the program a file; stored here are account-encrypted password pairs. There are options to encrypt a password and add a new account,
                    decrypt a password, update a password (re-encrypt), delete an account, or list the accounts currently in the file. Nothing fancy, but a good way to practice with a new language, and a helpful way for me to avoid forgetting passwords.</p>
