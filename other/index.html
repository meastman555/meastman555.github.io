                <p class="content_description">That's right! I built this basic portfolio from the ground up using basic vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JS6 that I learned from Stackskills© tutorials, 
                    during my time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of media queries ensures that it will dynamically look good on any-sized screen. Being new to web-dev, 
                    there are certainly things I could do better and clean up -- as I continue to practice and learn new skills and languages, this site will likely change for the better!
                    This is the second version of this site, a complete stylized overhaul from the first iteration. The code for both can be seen on GitHub!

                <h1 class="list_title">PintOS</h1>
                <p class="content_description">A toy operating system that I heavily expanded on as part of my Operating Systems class at UT, along with my group members. 
                    We designed and implemented various aspects of functionality for this OS, such as priority donation (used to improve locks and semaphores) and scheduling, 
                    the ability to support user-programs and handle system calls, virtual memory (including a frame table, supplemental page table, and swap table), and a 
                    file-system (using our own implemented double-indirect blocks) with working disk permanance and directory navigation/manipulation structures. 
                    I always find myself referencing these concepts, as even the higher level video game code I write for my projects can be traced back to these fundamental 
                    computer and programming concepts -- it was also great experience with working within a large, partially completed codebase. Due to this being a series of 
                    school projects for grades, I am unable to share the code I wrote.

                <p class="content_description">During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent some of my time in quarantine learning the basics of Python through Stackskills© tutorials. 
                    My first independent project is a password encrypter/decrypter that uses the Vigenère cipher (which encrypts words/phrases with a user-memorized key). 
                    Users will give the program a file; stored here are account-encrypted password pairs. There are options to encrypt a password and add a new account, 
                    decrypt a password, update a password (re-encrypt), delete an account, or list the accounts currently in the file. Nothing fancy, but a good way to practice 
                    with a new language, and a helpful way for me to avoid forgetting passwords.
